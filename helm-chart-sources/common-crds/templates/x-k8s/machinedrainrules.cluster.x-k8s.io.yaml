                        with the order field. When draining Pods of a Node the Pods will be grouped by order
                        and one group after another will be drained (by increasing order). Cluster API will
                        wait until all Pods of a group are terminated / removed from the Node before starting
                        with the next group.
                        "Skip" means that the Pods to which this MachineDrainRule applies will be skipped during drain.
                        "WaitCompleted" means that the pods to which this MachineDrainRule applies will never be evicted
                        and we wait for them to be completed, it is enforced that pods marked with this behavior always have Order=0.
